🌊 Wavefront
Because your brain has too many tabs open.

Check it out at: https://wavefrontproductivity.netlify.app/


Wavefront is here to save you from yourself. It’s a gorgeous, all-in-one productivity hub designed for students who want to actually get stuff done without looking at a UI that looks like a 1990s Excel spreadsheet.


🛠 What’s Under the Hood?
We didn’t use any bloated frameworks. No Shady frameworks of the Soviet Union. Just the Holy Trinity of the web:HTML,CSS and JS;


🌟 Features That'll Make You Actually Use It

📚 Subject & Task Tracking
Add your subjects, dump your to-dos, and watch the app judge your progress. It tracks how many goals you’ve actually done and how many you're left with.


⏳ The Focus Timer
A Pomodoro timer that doesn't just tick—it looks good doing it.Rinse and repeat till you finish your job.


🌓 Focus Mode
When you need to lock in. It strips away the noise.


🎵 Music:
Built-in music support because we know you can’t study in silence without hearing the existential dread creeping in.


🚀 Getting Started
Clone it: git clone [your-repo-link]

Open it: Double-click index.html.

Ascend: Become the organized version of yourself you’ve been lying about in New Year’s resolutions.


🧠 FAQ
Q: Why does it look so much better than my other projects? A: Taste. Some people have it, others use Comic Sans.

Q: Where is my data saved? A: Since this is Vanilla JS, we’re using localStorage. That means your data lives on your machine. If you clear your cache, your "to-dos" go to the same place your motivation goes on a Friday night: the void.

Q: Can I add 50 subjects? A: You can, but should you? Maybe pass the three you have first.
