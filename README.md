Wavefront is here to save you from yourself. It's a gorgeous, all-in-one productivity hub designed for students who want to actually get stuff done without looking at a UI that looks like a 1990s Excel spreadsheet.

## 🛠 What's Under the Hood?

We didn't use any bloated frameworks. No shady frameworks of the Soviet Union. Just the **Holy Trinity of the web**:

- **HTML**
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**

## 🌟 Features That'll Make You Actually Use It

### 📚 Subject & Task Tracking
Add your subjects, dump your to-dos, and watch the app judge your progress. It tracks how many goals you've actually done and how many you're left with.

### ⏳ The Focus Timer
A Pomodoro timer that doesn't just tick—it looks good doing it. Rinse and repeat till you finish your job.

### 🌓 Focus Mode
When you need to lock in. It strips away the noise.

### 🎵 Music
Built-in music support because we know you can't study in silence without hearing the existential dread creeping in.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone it:**
```bash
   git clone [your-repo-link]
```

2. **Open it:**  
   Double-click `index.html`

3. **Ascend:**  
   Become the organized version of yourself you've been lying about in New Year's resolutions.

## 🧠 FAQ

**Q: Why does it look so much better than my other projects?**  
A: Taste. Some people have it, others use Comic Sans.

**Q: Where is my data saved?**  
A: Since this is Vanilla JS, we're using `localStorage`. That means your data lives on your machine. If you clear your cache, your "to-dos" go to the same place your motivation goes on a Friday night: **the void**.

**Q: Can I add 50 subjects?**  
A: You can, but *should* you? Maybe pass the three you have first.
